  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.
  OVERMAPPING of BRAM resources should be ignored if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-BRAM resource or if placement fails.

Section 1 - Errors
------------------

Section 2 - Warnings
--------------------
WARNING:Place:1399 - A clock IOB / BUFGCTRL clock component pair have been found
   that are not placed at an optimal clock IOB / BUFGCTRL site pair. The clock
   IOB component <select> is placed at site <U2>. The corresponding BUFGCTRL
   component <select_BUFGP/BUFG> is placed at site <BUFGCTRL_X0Y28>. The clock
   IO can use the fast path between the IOB and the Clock Buffer if the IOB is
   placed on a Clock Capable IOB site that has dedicated fast path to BUFGCTRL
   sites in its half of the device (TOP or BOTTOM). You may want to analyze why
   this problem exists and correct it. This is normally an ERROR but the
   CLOCK_DEDICATED_ROUTE constraint was applied on COMP.PIN <select.PAD>
   allowing your design to continue. This constraint disables all clock placer
   rules related to the specified COMP.PIN. The use of this override is highly
   discouraged as it may lead to very poor timing results. It is recommended
   that this error condition be corrected in the design.
WARNING:PhysDesignRules:367 - The signal <start_IBUF> is incomplete. The signal
   does not drive any load pins in the design.

Section 3 - Informational
-------------------------
INFO:LIT:243 - Logical network start_IBUF has no load.
INFO:LIT:244 - All of the single ended outputs in this design are using slew
   rate limited output drivers. The delay on speed critical single ended outputs
   can be dramatically reduced by designating them as fast outputs.
INFO:Pack:1716 - Initializing temperature to 85.000 Celsius. (default - Range:
   0.000 to 85.000 Celsius)
INFO:Pack:1720 - Initializing voltage to 0.950 Volts. (default - Range: 0.950 to
   1.050 Volts)
INFO:Map:215 - The Interim Design Summary has been generated in the MAP Report
   (.mrp).
INFO:Pack:1650 - Map created a placed design.

Section 10 - Timing Report
--------------------------
A logic-level (pre-route) timing report can be generated by using Xilinx static
timing analysis tools, Timing Analyzer (GUI) or TRCE (command line), with the
mapped NCD and PCF files. Please note that this timing report will be generated
using estimated delay information. For accurate numbers, please generate a
timing report with the post Place and Route NCD file.

For more information about the Timing Analyzer, consult the Xilinx Timing
Analyzer Reference Manual; for more information about TRCE, consult the Xilinx
Command Line Tools User Guide "TRACE" chapter.
